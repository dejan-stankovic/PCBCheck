PCBCheck
========

A script for checking PCB production data (Extended Gerber - RS 274x format).

I use this script regularly to check my PCBs pre-production.

PCBCheck is currently configured to check double-sided boards with top marking only.
The current design

Note that PCBCheck does not replace your EDA design rule check, it rather supplements it.
While PCBCheck e.g. currently doesn't verify clearances, it (partially) verifies the files are names
correctly and present.

The file naming scheme that is configured in PCBCheck is the one listed at [MultiCB](http://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/en/support/pcb-data/gerber-data.html).

Contributions are welcome.
